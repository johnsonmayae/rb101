# Write a method that takes a floating point number that represents an angle between 
# 0 and 360 degrees and returns a String that represents that angle in degrees, 
# minutes and seconds. You should use a degree symbol (Â°) to represent degrees, 
# a single quote (') to represent minutes, and a double quote (") to represent seconds. 
# A degree has 60 minutes, while a minute has 60 seconds.
